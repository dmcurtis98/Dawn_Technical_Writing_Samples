# SME Notes – Thermometer Calibration

> "So, you turn the thing on and it takes a bit to warm up. It shows like 'READY' after that. Then there’s a test mode where you put it against a known temp water bath, we usually do 37°C but you can do others. You compare the reading to the standard thermometer. If it’s off more than 0.2°C, there’s a little menu under Settings where you can adjust offset, just don’t forget to write down what you did in the log. After that you just hit Exit, it saves automatically. Oh, and the batteries have to be above 60%, otherwise readings drift."
