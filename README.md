# Dawn's Technical Writing Portfolio

This portfolio contains self-directed projects that demonstrate professional-level technical writing skills. While new to the technical writing field, I've modeled these samples on real-world standards to show my ability to quickly contribute in a professional environment.

Each project showcases my process for transforming unstructured subject-matter-expert (SME) notes into clear, accurate, and compliant documentation.
